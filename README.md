##Taijutsu
Taijutsu buffs I have in mind
Front lotus buff, the speed is nice but i cant setup as easily as with lion combo since i cant use jutsu while gated

Leaf Gale bug fix (what ur supposed to be able to use to setup lion combo or front lotus but its bugged)

Morning Peacock (supposed to be the big payoff to going to 6 gates but does very little damage and hard to hit) maybe buff the size of the explosions or maybe rework to be a short buff like chakra enhancement that gives gated users a ranged punch (like hosenka but stronger)

Fist of nirvana buff or bugfix: the slow doesn't work and if it ever does (havent seen it work) it doesnt do anymore then randomly getting a daze off

If you decide to do any of these then actual punches with crits need a nerf cause 3k hits arent very cool. Maybe nerf the passives affect from 10% increase per point to like 7.5% increase or less


##Ninjutsu
Elemental Ninjutsu Balance Changes-

Goal- To make niche options in elemental jutsu tree a little more desirable, as “Team” jutsu are less important to people who think this game is solo play only. Desirably, give combo jutsu that don’t work without a second person to capitalize (Like water prison) slightly more effective in solo play and make them shine brighter in team play to add more variety to people’s builds/elemental jutsu choices.

Air Pressure Damage- Increase damage or perhaps add slight wounds? Should it proc multiple damage like mud flow that scales with chakra charge, instead of one big sum of damage? You could decrease the damage substantially if it multi hits, or make the initial hit large and the subsequent hits smaller. Currently it serves as a worse version of mud flow that costs more chakra and SP for slightly increased width. Haven’t tested with full con investment, but even if it does 5k damage, the difficulty of landing it (it requires you to charge it for a substantial amount of time, making it uncomboable without outside assistance) added to the fact that it costs substantial payoff to get any sort of DECENT damage.


Water Bullet- Tracking is kind of bad, add a slight slow that stacks with each subsequent bullet hit and give better tracking? Currently 400 damage per tick and very poor tracking, making it an unreliable and undesirable jutsu.

Water Prison- Slow health drain overtime from people suffocating And/or allow certain jutsu (water element only, or fire that can cause water to boil.) to pass through. Currently its a stun with no followup, as it doesn’t drain health or chakra for the victim, and they can’t be hit by jutsu while inside the water prison. It serves as a pause button that disrupts combot flow, and has no other use, because most people don’t want a Pause button in a PvP video game, especially when it harms the user (losing chakra) while doing nothing to the enemy
Sticky Capture Field- Disallow shunshin, similar to Doton swamp. Make it chargeable to increase the size of the wave (Length only, not width?)

Ash Pile Burning- Make it linger longer or make it much wider, as it is currently hard to land and combo into with current jutsu. Make it chargeable and increase size based on chakra invested perhaps? Damage is also a little laughable for a difficult to land jutsu.

Earth Shaking Palm- Add some more damage on top of the knockback and slow as well as auto KO for mole hiding. Not worth it to get if it's just a counter to mole hiding, as mole hiding is very easy to counter at the moment. It also requires heavy investment (2300 on both the doton chamber and crush, and 2000 more for a skill that's primary use is to KO someone using mole hiding, which is rare and not that good to begin with) I feel like if the damage increases a little more the slow would be enough to push it into a skill people want, and maybe removing other earth jutsu as a prerequisite.

Mole Hiding- Make movement slightly faster in mole hiding? Currently very difficult, if not impossible to land as it doesn’t break tracking and people can see the unfilled in arrow, which is a dead giveaway.. Also, Uchiha can see people in mole hiding with Sharingan, is that bug or intentional. Reward players for using it stelathily by allowing it to break target, as a surprise move.
Four Pillar Binding- Decrease cast time as the cast time currently makes it nearly impossible to land without a prior slow/CC, and even then it's hard to hit. Maybe make it larger? Cooldown is also extremely long for a niche jutsu that is difficult to land. If its hard to land, it should have a shorter cooldown. Maybe be cautious about implementing a faster activation time and lower cooldown, as it might overtune it.
